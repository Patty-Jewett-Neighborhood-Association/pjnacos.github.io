											<h2>Neighborhood History</h2>
											<h3>By neighborhood historian, Tim Scanlon</h3>
										</header>
										<p>

Located near downtown Colorado Springs, the Patty Jewett Neighborhood is a diverse collection of homes, businesses, and public spaces that has evolved for over a century. The 1912 City Plan, crafted by pioneer city planner Charles Mulford Robinson, shows the southwest portion of the neighborhood developed first, south of Columbia St and east from Wahsatch.

<p>Named for its historic association with the adjacent Patty Jewett Golf Course, the original fairways of the 1897 Town and Gown Golf Course were located northeast of Columbia and El Paso Streets. The 1899 clubhouse building remains today as a private home at the northeast corner of El Paso and Columbia. 

<p>Ten years later, the course was moved to its current location and renamed the Colorado Springs Golf Club. The existing clubhouse was designed by architects MacLaren & Thomas. Thomas also lived in the neighborhood and later designed the iron gated entry.  In 1919, William K. Jewett, an early club member, purchased and donated it to the City as a self-sustaining facility in honor of his wife, Patty Stuart Jewett, an avid golfer and outdoor sportswoman. It was named the Patty Jewett Memorial Field.

<p>Bordered on the east by the Golf Course and Shooks Run stream, the neighborhood's northern boundary is East Fontanero Street. To the west, the boundary is the alley between Wahsatch Avenue, westernmost of the four north-south Avenues originating downtown and Corona Street, and the southern boundary is East Uintah Street. What is now the Shooks Run Trail, curving north and west through the southern portion of the neighborhood, was originally the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, used for passenger trains heading north from the Santa Fe Depot east of downtown.

<p>One of the oldest houses in the city is located at the northeast corner of Espanola and El Paso Street. This was the home of W. E. Pabor, publicist and secretary of the Fountain Colony, which was created as the development entity for the City by its founder, General William J. Palmer. It was donated for use as the community’s first school, and Palmer’s wife, Queenie, was its first teacher. It was moved here in the 1920’s. 

<p>A remnant from an earlier age, a 1904 grocery market, as well as a 1920s gasoline filling station and garage can be found at the intersection of Columbia and Corona Streets. The market was a necessity for the neighborhood in a pre-automobile and pre-supermarket era. Another building, at the southwest corner of Corona and Espanola, was originally a 1924 home-builder’s showroom before housing another market, then a print shop; it’s now a law office.

<p>Taylor Elementary school, named after Alice Bemis Taylor, noted philanthropist and co-founder of the city’s Fine Arts Center, has educated neighborhood children since 1952. A recent addition to the neighborhood is the Casa Verde Commons, the city’s first Co-Housing community, located on the site of a former greenhouse that once provided fresh flowers to the region.

<p>Housing styles in the neighborhood range from late-Victorian frame houses to craftsman and mission. Bungalows are mixed with one-story ranches, and are interspersed with minimal traditional and modern forms. Streets are generally laid out in a grid; most blocks have alleys and sidewalks, and mature trees grace the area. The neighborhood is popular with young families, as homes are relatively modest in size with large back yards.

											<h2>Who was Patty Jewett?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>

Patty Jewett and her husband William K. Jewett were members of the health seeking movement that arrived in Colorado Springs in the latter half of the 19th Century. Settling into the social swirl as the Cripple Creek Mining District hit its stride, William focused on finance at Colorado Springs National Bank, eventually rising to his position as Vice-President, and Patty threw herself into charity work. Known for their love of gardening, their home at 1507 North Cascade Avenue displayed one of the largest rose gardens in the region. Both loved golf, and helped to reestablish the old Town and Gown Golf Club as the Colorado Springs Golf Club in 1910. Although they moved to California in 1913, they maintained their contact locally. After Patty died in 1917, William elected to donate the golf course to the City, to be renamed in honor of his wife.
<p>The wrought iron gate to the course was designed by Charles E. Thomas in 1926 and was William's final gift to the citizens of Colorado Springs.
